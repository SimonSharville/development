          <p>Visiting lecturer at the Arts Institute Bournemouth for the BA Hons Modelmaking degree and at the Royal College of Art for the Industrial Design Engineering and M.A. Interior Architecture courses..</p>

          <p>I have also enjoyed devising, creating, and hosting educational workshops in London, Europe and the Far East generating awareness of architecture and teaching adults and children the role of modelmaking within the process of design. Design Museum, London. Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Royal Academy of Arts, London. CaixaForum Barcelona/Madrid, Spain. Beijing Capital Museum. IFC Mall, Hong Kong. Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taiwan.</p>

          <h3>Sorrel Foundation Masterclass</h3>
          <p>Created and hosted workshops with 14 – 16yr old college children centred on modelmaking and the concept of Scale. The models produced were exhibited at the Somerset House Embankment Galleries.</p>

          <h3>Victoria and Albert Museum, London</h3>
          <p>Created and hosted Educational workshops for 6-8yr olds and 14-16yr olds as part of ‘Create!’ </p>

          <h4>Workshop Outline</h4>
          <p><i>The ‘Create!’ workshop is designed to introduce young people to architecture, from the house to the city, by giving them an overview of the processes of design – understanding a brief, design a building and create a model within the context of a city.</i></p>
          
          <p><i>Using a map of London, each participant will be allocated a plot of land and building type such as residential, office, park, cultural centre etc and asked to create a design.  Participants are encouraged to consider the layout of the city and how building types relate to each other and how this may influence their design.  Specialist architectural modelmakers will give a demonstration on how to build a model and give hands-on advice and guidance on how to realise the participant’s model design using recycled and professional modelmaking materials.</i></p>
          
          <p><i>The participants will gain knowledge of how buildings are designed within a city and the relationship between buildings and public spaces.  They will also develop their communication skills by sharing their ideas and taking part in critiques of their designs within the group.</i></p>
          
          <p><i>At the end of the workshop, all participants will present their designs to the group and their models will be displayed on the map to create a new city.</i></p>

          <h3>Royal Academy of Arts, London</h3>
          <p>I created and hosted Educational workshops as part of the exhibition ‘Richard Rogers RA: Inside Out’.</p>
          <p><i>“This free drop-in workshop invites families to design and build their own architectural models inspired by London’s iconic bridges and buildings.
          A large graphic of the Thames will be installed in Gallery 10 of the exhibition and children can re-imagine the Capital and how buildings sit alongside or span the river. Over 70,000 brightly coloured Lego® bricks will be available for budding architects and engineers to construct their creations.
          The workshop has been devised by Mike Fairbrass.”</i></p>

          <p>I also took part in the RA LEGO Architecture Challenge.</p>
